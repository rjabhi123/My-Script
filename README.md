# Udacity-TV-Script-Generation
This is Udacity Deep Learning Project.

# Project Overview

This project is based on the TV Script Generation repo for the Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree.

It generates its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

# Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

          git clone https://github.com/HectorBudielE/udacity-tv-script-generation.git
	        cd udacity-tv-script-generation
          
2. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the requirements.txt file.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the steps.

           jupyter dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
           
 ### NOTE : 
      In the notebook, you will need to train RNNs in PyTorch. If your RNN is taking too long to train, feel free to pursue one of the options under the section Accelerating the Training Process below.
